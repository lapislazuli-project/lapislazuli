Lapislazuli - SCAM


This project is a scam.
8 investors got together and asked me to launch a blockchain for them. For my work, they could not pay in bitcoins, but they offered a masternode, saying that I could sell my coins at any time. I sold almost all of my share and earned 7 bitcoins (this is not a net profit from sales, I trading). I also have 450k lilly coins left that I successfully exchanged on the new network.
This team insulted me publicly, banned me from their server and ignores my messages.
Do not invest in lilli as I will sell my coins and crash the price, I just need time.
Another big detail. There were 15.5 million coins in the new premine network, I agree, it was necessary to distribute 1k1 to everyone, since at that time there were almost 15.5 million coins in the old network. But the swap was about 11k blocks, by that time 8 investors received an additional reward of 3 million coins. This is another little thing that speaks of the fraudulent start of the project.
